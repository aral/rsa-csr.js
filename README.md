RSA-CSR.js
==========

This is a work in progress.

I recently finished the EC variants:

* [ECDSA-CSR.js](https://git.coolaj86.com/coolaj86/ecdsa-csr.js)
* [Eckles.js](https://git.coolaj86.com/coolaj86/eckles.js)

I'm mostly done with [Rasha.js](https://git.coolaj86.com/coolaj86/rasha.js)
and I already have a working prototype to generate CSRs.

It'll all wrap up soon - expect it within a week.

In the meantime, I'm squatting the module name.
